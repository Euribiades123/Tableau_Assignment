Background of Assignemnt: 
    Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

    Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

    However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
 
Instructions:
    Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

    Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets from different periods.

    Four months of bike trip data were used:
        July 2023
        January 2023
        July 2022
        January 2022

Stipulations:
    I was only able to used 4 months of data. I would have like to go back as far back as 2019 in order to cover a period before, during and after the pandemic. Due to the large nature of the files and having to use Tableau Public i wasn't able to. I was having lots of errors and lag issues. 
    This way we can see the Year over Year increase for both January(a winter month) and July(a summer month). 

Analysis:
    In the first dashboard we can see the total number of rides for January and July 2022-2023 as well as the ridership increase YoY for those months and also the total increase between those two months. We can also see the peak hours for July(peak summer month) and the top 10 Citibike Stations based on starting journeys. 
    The second graph shows the total number of rides in the dataset, seperated by Casual Rider and Citibike annual member. 
    The third panel shows the peak riding times in July. We can see that there is a spike around 0800 and then it starts picking up around noon time and peaking at 1700. 
    The fourth panel shows peak times for January. Being a winter month, ridership peaks at 1700
    The next panel shows the Top 10 stations for starting a ride. all being located in Manhattan. Downtown, Midtown and the Southern part on central park. The next panel shows the top 10 stations for ending a journey. Again all being located in the bottom half of Manhattan. 
    The next panel shows the average times and distances for both members and casual riders. The distances are roughly the same for both, but where it really differs is in the length of time. Members ride for approximately 13 mins where as Casual Riders ride on average for 26 minutes. 
    The first map shows all the different stations when starting a ride with color coding showing the busier stations in green. Here we can see that the bottom half of Manhattan is the busiest. 
    The following map shows the top stations for starting and ending journeys. All located in the bottom half of Manhattan 
    The second dashboard shows a map of the Top Stations for starting and ending journeys as well as graphs for the top 10 stations for starting a ride and the top 10 for ending a ride. These graphs also show differentiation bettwen casual and member rides.
